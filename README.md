Creating container image for the School Project


I Created container image for a used cars database. It built off the MariaDB image from Docker Hub and will support running a PHP web application to edit the items in database. I documented the process of creating image and as well as create a getting start guide for the developer that will be using the image to create the PHP application. The image will initially be run on the developer’s machine in Docker, and later can be deployed on a company’s internal network.
